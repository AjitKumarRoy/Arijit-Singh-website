                mother.[15] His paternal family came from Lahore 
                during the Partition.[14] He began his music training at
                a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained

                later at the Sripat Singh College, a University

                a decent student, but cared more about music" and 
                his parents decided to train him professionally. 
                He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra 
                Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra

                Rabindra Sangeet (songs written and composed by 
                Rabindranath Tagore) and pop music.[15] At the 
                age of three, he started training under the Hazari b
                rothers, and at the age of nine, he got a scholarship 
                from the government for training in vocals in Indian
