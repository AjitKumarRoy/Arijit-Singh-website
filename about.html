                Sikh father[14] and Aditi Singh, a Bengali Hindu 
                mother.[15] His paternal family came from Lahore 
                during the Partition.[14] He began his music training at
                a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained
                in Indian classical music, and his maternal grandmother
                used to sing. His maternal uncle played the tabla, 
                and his mother also sang and played the tabla.
                He studied at Raja Bijay Singh High School and 
                later at the Sripat Singh College, a University 
                of Kalyani affiliate.[15] According to him he "was 
                a decent student, but cared more about music" and 
                his parents decided to train him professionally. 
                He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra 
                Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra 
                Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him 
                Rabindra Sangeet (songs written and composed by 
                Rabindranath Tagore) and pop music.[15] At the 
                age of three, he started training under the Hazari b
                rothers, and at the age of nine, he got a scholarship 
                from the government for training in vocals in Indian 
                classical music.</p>
